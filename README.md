# deloitte-digital-syntax theme

A clear and readable syntax theme based on the Deloitte (Digital) color scheme. This is an unofficial theme for use with the Atom editor.

It is designed to be used with the default Atom-One UI Theme, but it basically works with any dark theme. Forked from the default One-Dark syntax theme, so this one has a huge language support as well.
